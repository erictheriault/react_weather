## Summary

This is a very basic weather app that allows you to enter your zip code and receive
the current weather conditions.

For this application to function properly, there should be an environment variable
set that provides an Open Weather API key. The variable name is `REACT_APP_WEATHER_API_KEY`.
Please contact Eric if you would like to use his to test this demo.

## React Notes

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

In the project directory, you can run:

```
npm start
```

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

```
npm run build
```

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
